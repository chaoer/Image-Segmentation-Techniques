%% Deblurring Images Using the Lucy-Richardson Algorithm 
% This example shows how to use the Lucy-Richardson algorithm to deblur images.
% It can be used effectively when the point-spread function PSF (blurring
% operator) is known, but little or no information is available for the
% noise. The blurred and noisy image is restored by the iterative, accelerated,
% damped Lucy-Richardson algorithm.  The additional optical system (e.g. camera)
% characteristics can be used as input parameters to improve the quality of the
% image restoration.

%% Step 1: Read Image
% The example reads in an RGB image and crops it to be 256-by-256-by-3. The
% |deconvlucy| function can handle arrays of any dimension.

I = imread('board.tif');
I = I(50+(1:256),2+(1:256),:);
figure;imshow(I);title('Original Image');

%% Step 2: Simulate a Blur and Noise
% Simulate a real-life image that could be blurred (e.g., due to camera
% motion or lack of focus) and noisy (e.g., due to random disturbances).
% The example simulates the blur by convolving a Gaussian filter with the
% true image (using |imfilter|). The Gaussian filter then represents a
% point-spread function, |PSF|.

PSF = fspecial('gaussian',5,5);
Blurred = imfilter(I,PSF,'symmetric','conv');
figure;imshow(Blurred);title('Blurred');

%%
% The example simulates the noise by adding a Gaussian noise of variance
% |V| to the blurred image (using |imnoise|). The noise variance |V| is used
% later to define a damping parameter of the algorithm. 

V = .002;
BlurredNoisy = imnoise(Blurred,'gaussian',0,V);
figure;imshow(BlurredNoisy);title('Blurred & Noisy');

%% Step 3: Restore the Blurred and Noisy Image
% Restore the blurred and noisy image providing the PSF and using only 5
% iterations (default is 10). The output is an array of the same type as
% the input image.

luc1 = deconvlucy(BlurredNoisy,PSF,5);
figure;imshow(luc1);title('Restored Image, NUMIT = 5');

%% Step 4: Iterate to Explore the Restoration
% The resulting image changes with each iteration. To investigate the
% evolution of the image restoration, you can do the deconvolution in
% steps: do a set of iterations, see the result, and then resume the
% iterations from where they were stopped. To do so, the input image has to
% be passed as a part of a cell array (e.g., start first set of iterations
% by passing in |{BlurredNoisy}| instead of |BlurredNoisy| as input image
% parameter). 

luc1_cell = deconvlucy({BlurredNoisy},PSF,5);

%%
% In that case the output, |luc1_cell|, becomes a cell array. The cell output
% consists of four numeric arrays, where the first is the |BlurredNoisy|
% image, the second is the restored image of class double, the third array
% is the result of the one-before-last iteration, and the fourth array is
% an internal parameter of the iterated set. The second numeric array of
% the output cell-array, image |luc1_cell{2}|, is identical to the output
% array of the Step 3, image |luc1|, with a possible exception of their class
% (the cell output always gives the restored image of class double).

%%
% To resume the iterations, take the output from the previous function
% call, the cell-array |luc1_cell|, and pass it into the |deconvlucy| function.
% Use the default number of iterations (|NUMIT| = 10). The restored image is
% the result of a total of 15 iterations.

luc2_cell = deconvlucy(luc1_cell,PSF);
luc2 = im2uint8(luc2_cell{2});
figure;imshow(luc2);title('Restored Image, NUMIT = 15');

%% Step 5: Control Noise Amplification by Damping
% The latest image, |luc2|, is the result of 15 iterations. Although it is
% sharper than the earlier result from 5 iterations, the image develops a
% "speckled" appearance. The speckles do not correspond to any real
% structures (compare it to the true image), but instead are the result of
% fitting the noise in the data too closely. 

%%
% To control the noise amplification, use the damping option by specifying
% the |DAMPAR| parameter. |DAMPAR| has to be of the same class as the input
% image. The algorithm dampens changes in the model in regions where the
% differences are small compared with the noise. The |DAMPAR| used here
% equals 3 standard deviations of the noise. Notice that the image is
% smoother.

DAMPAR = im2uint8(3*sqrt(V));
luc3 = deconvlucy(BlurredNoisy,PSF,15,DAMPAR);
figure;imshow(luc3);
title('Restored Image with Damping, NUMIT = 15');

%%
% The next part of this example explores the |WEIGHT| and |SUBSMPL| input
% parameters of the deconvlucy function, using a simulated star image (for
% simplicity & speed).

%% Step 6: Create Sample Image
% The example creates a black/white image of four stars. 

I = zeros(32);I(5,5)=1;I(10,3)=1;I(27,26)=1;I(29,25)=1;
figure;imshow(1-I,[],'InitialMagnification','fit');
set(gca,'Visible','on','XTickLabel',[],'YTickLabel',[],...
'XTick',[7 24],'XGrid','on','YTick',[5 28],'YGrid','on');
title('Data');

%% Step 7: Simulate a Blur
% The example simulates a blur of the image of the stars by creating a
% Gaussian filter, |PSF|, and convolving it with the true image.

PSF = fspecial('gaussian',15,3);
Blurred = imfilter(I,PSF,'conv','sym');

%%
% Now simulate a camera that can only observe part of the stars' images
% (only the blur is seen). Create a weighting function array, WEIGHT, that
% consists of ones in the central part of the Blurred image ("good" pixels,
% located within the dashed lines) and zeros at the edges ("bad" pixels -
% those that do not receive the signal).

WT = zeros(32);WT(6:27,8:23) = 1;
CutImage = Blurred.*WT;

%%
% To reduce the ringing associated with borders, apply the edgetaper
% function with the given PSF.

CutEdged = edgetaper(CutImage,PSF);
figure;imshow(1-CutEdged,[],'InitialMagnification','fit');
set(gca,'Visible','on','XTickLabel',[],'YTickLabel',[],...
'XTick',[7 24],'XGrid','on','YTick',[5 28],'YGrid','on');
title('Observed');

%% Step 8: Provide the WEIGHT Array
% The algorithm weights each pixel value according to the WEIGHT array
% while restoring the image. In our example, only the values of the central
% pixels are used (where WEIGHT = 1), while the "bad" pixel values are
% excluded from the optimization. However, the algorithm can place the
% signal power into the location of these "bad" pixels, beyond the edge of
% the camera's view. Notice the accuracy of the resolved star positions.

luc4 = deconvlucy(CutEdged,PSF,300,0,WT);
figure;imshow(1-luc4,[],'InitialMagnification','fit');
set(gca,'Visible','on','XTickLabel',[],'YTickLabel',[],...
'XTick',[7 24],'XGrid','on','YTick',[5 28],'YGrid','on');
title('Restored');

%% Step 9: Provide a finer-sampled PSF
% deconvlucy can restore undersampled image given a finer sampled PSF
% (finer by SUBSMPL times). To simulate the poorly resolved image and PSF,
% the example bins the |Blurred| image and the original PSF, two pixels in
% one, in each dimension. 

Binned = squeeze(sum(reshape(Blurred,[2 16 2 16])));
BinnedImage = squeeze(sum(Binned,2));
Binned = squeeze(sum(reshape(PSF(1:14,1:14),[2 7 2 7])));
BinnedPSF = squeeze(sum(Binned,2));
figure;imshow(1-BinnedImage,[],'InitialMagnification','fit');
set(gca,'Visible','on','XTick',[],'YTick',[]);
title('Binned Observed');

%%
% Restore the undersampled image, |BinnedImage|, using the undersampled PSF,
% |BinnedPSF|. Notice that the |luc5| image distinguishes only 3 stars.

luc5 = deconvlucy(BinnedImage,BinnedPSF,100);
figure;imshow(1-luc5,[],'InitialMagnification','fit');
set(gca,'Visible','on','XTick',[],'YTick',[]);
title('Poor PSF');

%%
% The next example restores the undersampled image (|BinnedImage|), this time
% using the finer PSF (defined on a SUBSMPL-times finer grid). The
% reconstructed image (|luc6|) resolves the position of the stars more
% accurately. Note how it distributes power between the two stars in the
% lower right corner of the image. This hints at the existence of two
% bright objects, instead of one, as in the previous restoration. 

luc6 = deconvlucy(BinnedImage,PSF,100,[],[],[],2);
figure;imshow(1-luc6,[],'InitialMagnification','fit');
set(gca,'Visible','on','XTick',[],'YTick',[]);
title('Fine PSF');

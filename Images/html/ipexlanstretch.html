%% Enhancing Multispectral Color Composite Images
% This example shows some basic image composition and enhancement techniques for
% use with multispectral data.  It is often necessary to enhance multispectral
% radiance or reflectance data to create an image that is suitable for visual
% interpretation.  The example uses Landsat thematic mapper imagery covering
% part of Paris, France. Seven spectral bands are stored in one file in the
% Erdas LAN format. Concepts covered include:
% 
% * Reading multispectral data from Erdas LAN files
% * Constructing color composites from different band combinations
% * Enhancing imagery with a contrast stretch
% * Enhancing imagery with a decorrelation stretch
% * Using scatterplots

%% Step 1: Construct Truecolor Composite from a Multispectral Image
% The LAN file, |paris.lan|, contains a 7-band 512-by-512 Landsat image. 
% A 128-byte header is followed by the pixel values, which are band
% interleaved by line (BIL) in order of increasing band number.  They
% are stored as unsigned 8-bit integers, in little-endian byte order.
%
% Read bands 3, 2, and 1 from the LAN file using the MATLAB(R) function
% |multibandread|.  These bands cover the visible part of the spectrum.
% When they are mapped to the red, green, and blue planes, respectively, of
% an RGB image, the result is a standard truecolor composite.  The final
% input argument to |multibandread| specifies which bands to read, and in
% which order, so that you can construct an RGB composite in a single step.
truecolor = multibandread('paris.lan', [512, 512, 7], 'uint8=>uint8', ...
                          128,  'bil', 'ieee-le', {'Band','Direct',[3 2 1]});

%%
% The truecolor composite has very little contrast and the colors are
% unbalanced.
figure
imshow(truecolor);
title('Truecolor Composite (Un-enhanced)')
text(size(truecolor,2), size(truecolor,1) + 15,...
  'Image courtesy of Space Imaging, LLC',...
  'FontSize', 7, 'HorizontalAlignment', 'right')

%% Step 2: Use Histograms to Explore Un-Enhanced Truecolor Composite
%
% By viewing a histogram of the red band, for example, you can see that the
% data is concentrated within a small part of the available dynamic range.
% This is one reason why the truecolor composite appears dull.
figure
imhist(truecolor(:,:,1))
title('Histogram of the Red Band (Band 3)')

%% Step 3: Use Correlation to Explore Un-Enhanced Truecolor Composite
% Another reason for the dull appearance of the composite is that the
% visible bands are highly correlated with each other.  Two- and three-band
% scatterplots are an excellent way to gauge the degree of correlation
% among spectral bands.  You can make them easily just by using |plot|.
r = truecolor(:,:,1);
g = truecolor(:,:,2);
b = truecolor(:,:,3);

plot3(r(:),g(:),b(:),'.')
grid('on')
xlabel('Red (Band 3)')
ylabel('Green (Band 2)')
zlabel('Blue (Band 1)')
title('Scatterplot of the Visible Bands')

%%
% The pronounced linear trend of the red-green-blue scatterplot indicates
% that the visible bands are highly correlated. This helps explain the
% monochromatic look of the un-enhanced truecolor composite.

%% Step 4: Enhance Truecolor Composite with a Contrast Stretch
% When you use |imadjust| to apply a linear contrast stretch to the
% truecolor composite image, the surface features are easier to recognize.
stretched_truecolor = imadjust(truecolor,stretchlim(truecolor));
figure
imshow(stretched_truecolor)
title('Truecolor Composite after Contrast Stretch')

%% Step 5: Check Histogram Following the Contrast Stretch
% A histogram of the red band after applying a contrast stretch shows that
% the data has been spread over much more of the available dynamic range. 
figure
imhist(stretched_truecolor(:,:,1))
title('Histogram of Red Band (Band 3) after Contrast Stretch')

%% Step 6: Enhance Truecolor Composite with a Decorrelation Stretch
% Another way to enhance the truecolor composite is to use a decorrelation
% stretch, which enhances color separation across highly correlated
% channels. Use |decorrstretch| to perform the decorrelation stretch
% (followed by a linear contrast stretch, as specified by the optional
% parameter-value pair |'Tol'| and |0.1|). 
decorrstretched_truecolor = decorrstretch(truecolor, 'Tol', 0.01);
figure
imshow(decorrstretched_truecolor)
title('Truecolor Composite after Decorrelation Stretch')

%%
% Again, surface features have become much more clearly visible, but in a
% different way.  The spectral differences across the scene have been
% exaggerated.  A noticeable example is the area of green on the left edge,
% which appears black in the contrast-stretched composite. This green area
% is the Bois de Boulogne, a large park on the western edge of Paris.

%% Step 7: Check Correlation Following the Decorrelation Stretch
% As expected, a scatterplot following the decorrelation stretch shows a
% strong decrease in correlation. 
r = decorrstretched_truecolor(:,:,1);
g = decorrstretched_truecolor(:,:,2);
b = decorrstretched_truecolor(:,:,3);

plot3(r(:),g(:),b(:),'.')
grid('on')
xlabel('Red (Band 3)')
ylabel('Green (Band 2)')
zlabel('Blue (Band 1)')
title('Scatterplot of the Visible Bands after Decorrelation Stretch')

%% Step 8: Construct and Enhance a CIR Composite
% Just as with the visible bands, information from Landsat bands covering
% non-visible portions of the spectrum can be viewed by constructing and
% enhancing RGB composite images.  The near infrared (NIR) band (Band 4) is
% important because of the high reflectance of chlorophyll in this part of
% the spectrum.  It is even more useful when combined with visible red and
% green (Bands 3 and 2, respectively) to form a color infrared (CIR) composite
% image. Color infrared (CIR) composites are commonly used to identify
% vegetation or assess its state of growth and/or health.

%%
% Construct a CIR composite by reading from the original LAN file and
% composing an RGB image that maps bands 4, 3, and 2 to red, green, and
% blue, respectively.
CIR = multibandread('paris.lan', [512, 512, 7], 'uint8=>uint8', ...
                    128,  'bil', 'ieee-le', {'Band','Direct',[4 3 2]});
 
%%
% Even though the near infrared (NIR) band (Band 4) is less correlated with
% the visible bands than the visible bands are with each other, a
% decorrelation stretch makes many features easier to see.
stretched_CIR = decorrstretch(CIR, 'Tol', 0.01);
figure
imshow(stretched_CIR)
title('CIR after Decorrelation Stretch')

%%
% A property of color infrared composites is that they look red in areas
% with a high vegetation (chlorophyll) density. Notice that the Bois de
% Boulogne park is red in the CIR composite, which is consistent with its
% green appearance in the decorrelation-stretched truecolor composite.

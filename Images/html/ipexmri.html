%% Exploring Slices from a 3-Dimensional MRI Data Set
% This example shows how to explore a volume of data by extracting slices
% through a three-dimensional MRI data set using |imtransform| and |tformarray|
% functions.

% Copyright 1993-2012 The MathWorks, Inc.

%% Step 1: Load and View Horizontal MRI
% This example uses the MRI data set that comes with MATLAB(R) and that is
% used in the help examples for both |montage| and |immovie|. Loading
% |mri.mat| adds two variables to the workspace: |D| (128-by-128-by-1-by-27,
% class uint8) and a grayscale colormap, |map| (89-by-3, class double).
%
% |D| comprises 27 128-by-128 horizontal slices from an MRI data scan of a human
% cranium. Values in |D| range from 0 through 88, so the colormap is needed to
% generate a figure with a useful visual range. The dimensionality of |D| makes
% it compatible with |montage|. The first two dimensions are spatial. The third
% dimension is the color dimension, with size 1 because it indexes into the
% color map. (|size(D,3)| would be 3 for an RGB image sequence.) The fourth
% dimension is temporal (as with any image sequence), but in this particular
% case it is also spatial. So there are three spatial dimensions in |D| and we
% can use |imtransform| or |tformarray| to convert the horizontal slices to
% sagittal slices (showing the view from the side of the head) or coronal
% (frontal) slices (showing the view from the front or back of the head).
%
% The spatial dimensions of |D| are ordered as follows:
% 
% * Dimension 1: Front to back of head (rostral/anterior to caudal/posterior) 
% * Dimension 2: Left to right of head 
% * Dimension 4: Bottom to top of head (inferior to superior).
%
% An important factor is that the sampling intervals are not the same along
% the three dimensions: samples along the vertical dimension (4) are spaced
% 2.5 times more widely than along the horizontal dimensions.

%% 
% Load the MRI data set and view the 27 horizontal slices as a montage.

load mri;
montage(D,map)
title('Horizontal Slices');

%% Step 2: Extract Sagittal Slice from Horizontal Slices Using IMTRANSFORM
% We can construct a mid-sagittal slice from the MRI data by taking a subset
% of |D| and transforming it to account for the different sampling intervals
% and the spatial orientation of the dimensions of |D|.
%
% The following statement extracts all the data needed for a midsagittal
% slice.

M1 = D(:,64,:,:); size(M1)

%%
% However we cannot view |M1| as an image because it is 128-by-1-by-1-by-27.
% |reshape| (or |squeeze|) can convert |M1| into a 128-by-27 image that
% is viewable with |imshow|.

M2 = reshape(M1,[128 27]); size(M2)
figure, imshow(M2,map);
title('Sagittal - Raw Data');

%%
% The dimensions in |M2| are ordered as follows:
%
% * Dimension 1: Front to back of head (rostral to caudal) 
% * Dimension 2: Bottom to top of head (inferior to superior). 
%
% We can obtain a much more satisfying view by transforming |M2| to change
% its orientation and increase the sampling along the vertical
% (inferior-superior) dimension by a factor of 2.5 REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH making the sampling
% interval equal in all three spatial dimensions. We could do this in steps
% starting with a transpose, but the following affine transformation
% enables a single-step transformation and more economical use of memory.

T0 = maketform('affine',[0 -2.5; 1 0; 0 0]);

%%
% The upper 2-by-2 block of the matrix passed to maketform, |0 -2.5;1 0]|,
% combines the rotation and scaling. After transformation we have:
%
% * Dimension 1: Top to bottom of head (superior to inferior). 
% * Dimension 2: Front to back of head (rostral to caudal) 

%%
% The call
%
% imtransform(M2,T0,'cubic')
% 
% would suffice to apply |T| to |M2| and provide good resolution while
% interpolating along the top to bottom direction. However, there is no
% need for cubic interpolation in the front to back direction, since no
% resampling will occur along (output) dimension 2. Therefore we specify
% nearest-neighbor resampling in this dimension, with greater efficiency
% and identical results.

R2 = makeresampler({'cubic','nearest'},'fill');
M3 = imtransform(M2,T0,R2);
figure, imshow(M3,map);
title('Sagittal - IMTRANSFORM')

%% Step 3: Extract Sagittal Slice from the Horizontal Slices Using TFORMARRAY
% In this step we obtain the same result as step 2, but use |tformarray| to go
% from three spatial dimensions to two in a single operation. Step 2 does
% start with an array having three spatial dimensions and end with an array
% having two spatial dimensions, but intermediate two-dimensional images (|M1|
% and |M2|) pave the way for the call to |imtransform| that creates
% |M3|. These intermediate images are not necessary if we use |tformarray|
% instead of |imtransform|. |imtransform| is very convenient for 2-D to 2-D
% transformations, but |tformarray| supports N-D to M-D transformations, where
% M need not equal N.

%%
% Through its |TDIMS_A| argument, |tformarray| allows us to define a
% permutation for the input array. Since we want to create an image with:
%
% * Dimension 1: Superior to inferior (original dimension 4, reversed) 
% * Dimension 2: Caudal to rostral (original dimension 1) 
%
% and extract just a single sagittal plane via the original dimension 2, we
% specify |tdims_a| = [4 1 2]. We create a |tform| via composition starting
% with a 2-D affine transformation |T1| that scales the (new) dimension 1 by a
% factor of -2.5 and adds a shift of 68.5 to keep the array coordinates
% positive. The second part of the composite is a custom transformation |T2|
% that extracts the 64th sagittal plane using a very simple |INVERSE_FCN|.

T1 = maketform('affine',[-2.5 0; 0 1; 68.5 0]);
inverseFcn = @(X,t) [X repmat(t.tdata,[size(X,1) 1])];
T2 = maketform('custom',3,2,[],inverseFcn,64);
Tc = maketform('composite',T1,T2);

%%
% Note that |T2| and |Tc| take a 3-D input to a 2-D input.

%%
% We use the same approach to resampling as before, but include a third dimension.

R3 = makeresampler({'cubic','nearest','nearest'},'fill');

%%
% |tformarray| transforms the three spatial dimensions of |D| to a 2-D output
% in a single step. Our output image is 66-by-128, with the original 27 planes
% expanding to 66 in the vertical (inferior-superior) direction.

M4 = tformarray(D,Tc,R3,[4 1 2],[1 2],[66 128],[],0);

%%
% The result is identical to the previous output of |imtransform|.

figure, imshow(M4,map);
title('Sagittal - TFORMARRAY');

%% Step 4: Create and Display Sagittal Slices
% We create a 4-D array (the third dimension is the color dimension) that can be
% used to generate an image sequence that goes from left to right, starts 30
% planes in, skips every other plane, and has 35 frames in total. The
% transformed array has:
%
% * Dimension 1: Top to bottom (superior to inferior) 
% * Dimension 2: Front to back (rostral to caudal) 
% * Dimension 4: Left to right. 

%%
% As in the previous step, we permute the input array using 
% |TDIMS_A = [4 1 2]|, again flipping and rescaling/resampling the vertical
% dimension. Our affine transformation is the same as the T1 above, except
% that we add a third dimension with a (3,3) element of 0.5 and (4,3) element
% of -14 chosen to map 30, 32, ... 98 to 1, 2, ..., 35. This centers our 35
% frames on the mid-sagittal slice.

T3 = maketform('affine',[-2.5 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 0.5; 68.5 0 -14]);

%%
% In our call to |tformarray|, |TSIZE_B = [66 128 35]| now includes the 35
% frames in the 4th, left-to-right dimension (which is the third transform
% dimension). The resampler remains the same.

S = tformarray(D,T3,R3,[4 1 2],[1 2 4],[66 128 35],[],0);

%%
% View the sagittal slices as a montage (padding the array slightly to separate 
% the elements of the montage).

S2 = padarray(S,[6 0 0 0],0,'both');
figure, montage(S2,map)
title('Sagittal Slices');

%% Step 5: Create and Display Coronal Slices
% Constructing coronal slices is almost the same as constructing sagittal
% slices. We change |TDIMS_A| from |[4 1 2]| to |[4 2 1]|. We create a series
% of 45 frames, starting 8 planes in and moving from back to front, skipping
% every other frame. The dimensions of the output array are ordered as
% follows:
%
% * Dimension 1: Top to bottom (superior to inferior) 
% * Dimension 2: Left to right 
% * Dimension 4: Back to front (caudal to rostral). 

T4 = maketform('affine',[-2.5 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 -0.5; 68.5 0 61]);

%%
% In our call to |tformarray|, |TSIZE_B| = [66 128 48] specifies the vertical,
% side-to-side, and front-to-back dimensions, respectively. The resampler
% remains the same.

C = tformarray(D,T4,R3,[4 2 1],[1 2 4],[66 128 45],[],0);

%%
% Note that all array permutations and flips in steps 3, 4, and 5 were handled
% as part of the |tformarray| operation.

%%
% View the coronal slices as a montage (padding the array slightly to separate 
% the elements of the montage).

C2 = padarray(C,[6 0 0 0],0,'both');
figure, montage(C2,map)
title('Coronal Slices');

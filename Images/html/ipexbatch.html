%% Batch Processing Image Files in Parallel
% This example shows how to batch process a set of image files in parallel.  A
% common image processing task is to apply an image processing algorithm to a
% series of files. This procedure can be time consuming if the algorithm is
% computationally intensive, if you are processing a large number of files, or
% if the files are very large.
%
% Batch processing performance can be improved if you have the 
% Parallel Computing Toolbox(TM) software.

% Copyright 2005-2012 The MathWorks, Inc.

%% Get the Names of Files to be Processed
% List the filenames with a common prefix. In this example, the image files are
% a set of 10 microscope images of rat prostate cancer cells. These files are
% only the first 10 of 100 images that were acquired.

p = which('AT3_1m4_01.tif');
filelist = dir([fileparts(p) filesep 'AT3_1m4_*.tif']);
fileNames = {filelist.name}'

%%
% View one of the images.

I = imread(fileNames{1});
imshow(I)
text(size(I,2),size(I,1)+15, ...
    'Image files courtesy of Alan Partin', ...
    'FontSize',7,'HorizontalAlignment','right');
text(size(I,2),size(I,1)+25, ...
    'Johns Hopkins University', ...
    'FontSize',7,'HorizontalAlignment','right');

%% Define Image Processing Algorithm to Use on Each Image
% Create an image processing function that segments non-touching cells in
% the microscope images. Test the function on one of your images.  

segmentedCells = batchDetectCells(I);
figure, imshow(segmentedCells)

%%
% To view |batchDetectCells| use this command.

type batchDetectCells

%% Loop over Images
% The function |batchProcessFiles| uses |parfor| to process each image
% independently. This works like a regular |for| loop but can take advantage of
% multiple processors if you have the Parallel Computing Toolbox software as
% described below.

%%
% To view |batchProcessFiles| use this command.

type batchProcessFiles

%%
% If you have the Parallel Computing Toolbox software, you can use local
% workers to distribute each cycle through the loop to a different worker.
% If you also have the MATLAB(R) Distributed Computing Server(TM), you can
% run your batch processing job on a cluster.
%
% You can use workers from the default parallel profile with this command
%
%  matlabpool open 
%
% Now call |batchProcessFiles| to apply the cell detection algorithm to each
% file.

segmentedCellSequence = batchProcessFiles(fileNames,@batchDetectCells);

%% Clean Up
% If you called |matlabpool| to start some workers, be sure to close them.
%
%  matlabpool close

%% Display Results
% Run the following command to see the sequence in |implay|. 

implay(segmentedCellSequence)

%%
% If you have data that does not all fit in memory, instead of returning the
% segmented image data in one large array, you can modify the body of the
% |parfor| loop in |batchProcessFiles.m| to either write each segmented
% image to a new file or write the whole segmented sequence to a multimedia file
% one image at a time. Then, you could review the results separate from the
% processing.

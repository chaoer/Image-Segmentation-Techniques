%% Detecting Cars in a Video of Traffic
% This example shows how to detect cars in a video of traffic.  You can use
% Image Processing Toolbox(TM) to visualize and analyze videos or image
% sequences. This example uses |VideoReader| (MATLAB(R)), |implay|, and other
% Image Processing Toolbox functions to detect light-colored cars in a video of
% traffic. Note that |VideoReader| has platform-specific capabilities and may
% not be able to read the supplied Motion JPEG2000 video on some platforms. See
% <matlab:doc('VideoReader') the documentation> for |VideoReader| for
% information on which formats are supported on your platform.

% Copyright 2007-2012 The MathWorks, Inc.

%% Step 1: Access Video with VideoReader
% The |VideoReader| function constructs a multimedia reader object that can
% read video data from a multimedia file.  See <matlab:doc('VideoReader')
% the documentation> for |VideoReader| for information on which formats are
% supported on your platform.
%   
% Use |VideoReader| to access the video and get basic information about it. 
trafficObj = VideoReader('traffic.mj2')

%%
% The get method provides more information on the video such as its
% duration in seconds.
get(trafficObj)

%% Step 2: Explore Video with IMPLAY
% Explore the video in |implay|. 

implay('traffic.mj2');

%% Step 3: Develop Your Algorithm
% When working with video data, it can be helpful to select a
% representative frame from the video and develop your algorithm on that
% frame. Then, this algorithm can be applied to the processing of all the
% frames in the video.
%
% For this car-tagging application, examine a frame that includes both
% light-colored and dark-colored cars. When an image has many structures,
% like the traffic video frames, it is useful to simplify the image as much
% as possible before trying to detect an object of interest. One way to do
% this for the car tagging application is to suppress all objects in the
% image that are not light-colored cars (dark-colored cars, lanes, grass,
% etc.). Typically, it takes a combination of techniques to remove these
% extraneous objects. 
%
% One way to remove the dark-colored cars from the video frames is to use
% the |imextendedmax| function. This function returns a binary image that
% identifies regions with intensity values above a specified threshold,
% called regional maxima. All other objects in the image with pixel values
% below this threshold become the background. To eliminate the dark-colored
% cars, determine the average pixel value for these objects in the image.
% (Use |rgb2gray| to convert the original video from RGB to grayscale.) You
% can use the pixel region tool in |implay| to view pixel values. Specify the
% average pixel value (or a value slightly higher) as the threshold when
% you call |imextendedmax|. For this example, set the value to 50.

darkCarValue = 50;
darkCar = rgb2gray(read(trafficObj,71));
noDarkCar = imextendedmax(darkCar, darkCarValue);
imshow(darkCar)
figure, imshow(noDarkCar)

%%
% In the processed image, note how most of the dark-colored car objects are
% removed but many other extraneous objects remain, particularly the
% lane-markings. The regional maxima processing will not remove the lane
% markings because their pixel values are above the threshold. To remove
% these objects, you can use the morphological function |imopen|. This
% function uses morphological processing to remove small objects from a
% binary image while preserving large objects. When using morphological
% processing, you must decide on the size and shape of the structuring
% element used in the operation. Because the lane-markings are long and
% thin objects, use a disk-shaped structuring element with radius
% corresponding to the width of the lane markings. You can use the pixel
% region tool in |implay| to estimate the width of these objects. For this
% example, set the value to 2. 

sedisk = strel('disk',2);
noSmallStructures = imopen(noDarkCar, sedisk);
imshow(noSmallStructures)

%%
% To complete the algorithm, use |regionprops| to find the centroid of the
% objects in |noSmallStructures| (should just be the light-colored cars).
% Use this information to position the tag on the light-colored cars in the
% original video. 

%% Step 4: Apply the Algorithm to the Video
% The car-tagging application processes the video one frame at a time in a
% loop. (Because a typical video contains a large number of frames, it
% would take a lot of memory to read and process all the frames at once.)
%
% A small video (like the one in this example) could be processed at once,
% and there are many functions that provide this capability. For more
% information, see <http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/images/f14-17682.html the Documentation>.
%
% For faster processing, preallocate the memory used to store the processed
% video.

nframes = get(trafficObj, 'NumberOfFrames');
I = read(trafficObj, 1);
taggedCars = zeros([size(I,1) size(I,2) 3 nframes], class(I));

for k = 1 : nframes
    singleFrame = read(trafficObj, k);
    
    % Convert to grayscale to do morphological processing.
    I = rgb2gray(singleFrame);
    
    % Remove dark cars.
    noDarkCars = imextendedmax(I, darkCarValue); 
    
    % Remove lane markings and other non-disk shaped structures.
    noSmallStructures = imopen(noDarkCars, sedisk);

    % Remove small structures.
    noSmallStructures = bwareaopen(noSmallStructures, 150);
   
    % Get the area and centroid of each remaining object in the frame. The
    % object with the largest area is the light-colored car.  Create a copy
    % of the original frame and tag the car by changing the centroid pixel
    % value to red.
    taggedCars(:,:,:,k) = singleFrame;
   
    stats = regionprops(noSmallStructures, {'Centroid','Area'});
    if ~isempty([stats.Area])
        areaArray = [stats.Area];
        [junk,idx] = max(areaArray);
        c = stats(idx).Centroid;
        c = floor(fliplr(c));
        width = 2;
        row = c(1)-width:c(1)+width;
        col = c(2)-width:c(2)+width;
        taggedCars(row,col,1,k) = 255;
        taggedCars(row,col,2,k) = 0;
        taggedCars(row,col,3,k) = 0;
    end
end

%% Step 5: Visualize Results
% Get the frame rate of the original video and use it to
% see |taggedCars| in |implay|. 

frameRate = get(trafficObj,'FrameRate');
implay(taggedCars,frameRate);

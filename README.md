Computer Vision Project
=========

1. Goals – build and test Matlab implementations of:
    - Active Contour Analysis (Szeliski 5.1)
    - Mean shift (Szeliski 5.3)
    - Expectation Maximization [E-M] method – mixture of Gaussians

2. Sources
    - Szeliski
    - Available Matlab implementation/sources
        * Matlab activecontour(.) function
        * UTexas HW #1 and other WWW sources for E-M method
        * Matlab implementations of Mean Shift
    - Any source you find

3. Report
    - Give mathematical and algorithmic theory for each method
    - Describe Matlab implementations and how to run the Matlab code
    - Test methods with gray-scale and color images
        * Vary parameters
    - Give well-commented code
    - Sum up observations on the pro’s and cons of the methods

4. Due date – Wednesday 18 December (during Final’s Week)
